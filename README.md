# Multi-Layer Perceptron

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) developed using Numpy.
This package implements the model of a basic Feed-Fordward Neural Network with two hidden layers and configurable number of neurons pro layer. Check **multi_layer_perceptron/model.py**
My goal was to better understand the mathematics behind how neural network works and evaluate how MLPs perform in simple classification tasks. In this package, the model is used for:
 1. Learning a non-linear boundary to separate two classes of datapoints in a 2D Space. **multi_layer_perceptron/circles.py**
 2. Classifying flowers (IRIS Dataset) **multi_layer_perceptron/iris.py**
 3. Classifying images of numbers from 0 to 9 (MNIST Dataset) **multi_layer_perceptron/mnist.py**
